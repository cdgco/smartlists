                    <br>PREAMBLE
                    <br>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
                    <br>development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
                    <br>efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
                    <br>open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
                    <br>with others.
                    <br>
                    <br>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
                    <br>redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
                    <br>fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
                    <br>redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
                    <br>names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
                    <br>however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
                    <br>requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
                    <br>to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
                    <br>

                    <br>Awesome Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
                    <br>attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using these

                    <br>
                    <br>We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
                    <br>to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
                    <br>learn about Font Awesome.
