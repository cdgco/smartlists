# CS 290 Final Project

## Setup

1. Run the command `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
2. Copy ".env.example" and paste it in the project root folder (same location).
3. Rename the copy to ".env"
4. Fill ".env" with the proper API keys.
5. Run the server with node. It can defaultly be accessed at http://localhost:8000/

**Note:** API keys should not be published in this repository, so make sure your ".env" is not getting picked up by git. The gitignore is configured to handle this as long as the file is named properly.
